# Go Playground firefox extension

There is a super slick chrome extension which does way more than this, but alas, I use firefox. This extension is a WIP and not suggested for use.

TODO list:

- [x] fix format button
- [x] fix go-mode indentations
- [x] fix keybind breaking behavoir
- [ ] fancify theme
- [ ] fix about toggle
- [ ] add keymap modes
- [ ] add theme modes (v2)
- [ ] add shortcut keys for run and format
- [ ] automatically select imports

----

Uses the codemirror js package.
