# Go Playground firefox extension

There is a super slick chrome extension which does way more than this, but alas, I use firefox. This extension is a WIP and not suggested for use.

TODO list:

- [ ] fix format button
- [x] fix go-mode indentations
- [x] fix keybind breaking behavoir
- [ ] fix about toggle
- [ ] add keymap modes
- [ ] add theme modes

Uses the codemirror js package.
