# Go Playground firefox extension

There is a super slick chrome extension which does way more than this, but alas, I use firefox. This extension is a WIP and not suggested for use.

TODO list:

- [ ] fix format button
- [ ] fix go-mode indentations
- [ ] fix keybind breaking behavoir

Uses the codemirror js package.
